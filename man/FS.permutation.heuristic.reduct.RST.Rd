\title{The permutation heuristic algorithm for determining a reduct}
\usage{
FS.permutation.heuristic.reduct.RST(decision.table, permutation = NULL,
  decisionIdx = ncol(decision.table), ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{decision.table}{a \code{"DecisionTable"} class
  representing the decision table. See
  \code{\link{SF.asDecisionTable}}.}

  \item{permutation}{a value representing whether we will
  randomize the conditional attributes or not.  The values
  of this parameter are \code{NULL} as default one and
  \code{FALSE}.}

  \item{decisionIdx}{an index of decision attribute. The
  default value is the last column of decision table.}

  \item{...}{other parameters.}
}
\value{
A class \code{"FeatureSubset"} that contains the following
components: \itemize{ \item \code{reduct}: a list
representing a single reduct. In this case, it could be a
superreduct or just a subset of features. \item
\code{type.method}: a string representing the type of
method which is \code{"permutation.heuristic"}. \item
\code{type.task}: a string showing the type of task which
is \code{"feature selection"}. \item \code{model}: a string
representing the type of model. In this case, it is
\code{"RST"} which means rough set theory. }
}
\description{
It is a function implementing the permutation heuristic
approach based on RST.
}
\details{
Basically there are two processes in this algorithm which
are \itemize{ \item generating feature subset as
superreduct: In this step, we choose a subset of attributes
by evaluating the discernibility relation of pairs of
objects. \item eliminating feature subset to obtain a
reduct: we iterate over the superreduct resulting from the
previous process.  Then, an attribute that is
\emph{dispensable} in the subset is eliminated along
iteration. } The detail of the algorithm can be seen in
(Janusz and Slezak, 2012).

Additionally, \code{\link{SF.applyDecTable}} has been
provided to generate new decision table.
