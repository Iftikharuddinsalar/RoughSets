\value{
A class \code{"FeatureSubset"} that contains the following
components: \itemize{ \item \code{reduct}: a list
representing a single reduct. In this case, it could be a
superreduct or just a subset of features. \item
\code{type.method}: a string representing the type of
method which is \code{"greedy.heuristic"}. \item
\code{type.task}: a string showing the type of task which
is \code{"feature selection"}. \item \code{model}: a string
representing the type of model. In this case, it is
\code{"RST"} which means rough set theory. }

\description{
This is a function used for implementing a greedy heuristic
method for feature selection based on RST.
}
\details{
In this function, we have provided some quality measures of
subsets of attributes. The measure are important to
determine the quality of a subset to be a reduct. For
example, \code{X.entropy} is a measure of information gain.
We select one of the measures by assigning the
\code{qualityF} parameter.

Additionally, this function has implemented
\eqn{\epsilon}-approximate reducts. It means that the
method attempts to approximate the original decision model
by producing an approximate reduct which is subset of
attributes. The \eqn{\epsilon}-approximate can be defined
as

\eqn{Disc_{\mathcal{A}}(B) \ge (1 -
\epsilon)Disc_{\mathcal{A}}(A)}

where \eqn{Disc_{\mathcal{A}}(B)} is the discernibility
measure of attributes \eqn{B} in decision table
\eqn{\mathcal{A}} and \eqn{\epsilon} is numeric value
between 0 and 1. A lot of monographs provide comprehensive
explanations about this topics, for example (Janusz and
Stawicki, 2011; Slezak, 2002; Wroblewski, 2001) which are
used as the references of this function.

Additionally, \code{\link{SF.applyDecTable}} has been
provided to generate new decision table.
