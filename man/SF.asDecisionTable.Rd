\title{The construction function}
\usage{
SF.asDecisionTable(dataset, decision.attr = NULL, indx.nominal = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{a data frame representing the dataset that
  contains objects/instances and attributes/features in its
  rows and columns, respectively.  See in Section
  \code{Details}.}

  \item{decision.attr}{a numeric value representing the
  index position of the decision attribute. If we ignore
  this parameter, then the function will treat the data as
  an information system or newdata/testing data. In other
  words, we must define the index of decision attribute if
  we want to construct a decision table (i.e., a training
  dataset).}

  \item{indx.nominal}{a vector representing indexes of
  nominal values. It is used to define specific indexes as
  nominal attributes.  In a case, we do not define a value
  of this parameter, then the function will be using
  heuristic techniques to define the nominal attributes.
  The following is a technique that will be used: \itemize{
  \item string values: they will be recognized as
  nominal/symbolic values.  \item integer values: they will
  be recognized as continuous/real values.  \item
  decimal/real values: they will be recognized as
  continuous/real values.  \item indx.nominal: the
  attributes that are set in this parameter will be
  assigned as nominal values.  }}
}
\value{
A \code{"DecisionTable"} class which is the standard
decision table.
}
\description{
It is a function used to construct a standard decision
table in the \code{RoughSets} package. So, users are
strongly recommended to call this function first before any
other functions in this package.
}
\details{
The \code{RoughSets} package requires a standard decision
table to calculate a particular task. The standard decision
table is a \code{"DecisionTable"} class which constitutes
the set of all objects/instances (universe of discourse)
and other attributes. The objects are built by a table or
data frame where the number of rows and columns represent
the number of objects/instances and attributes,
respectively. Three important attributes that describe the
decision table are as follows. \itemize{ \item
\code{desc.attrs}: a list containing the names of
attributes and range of the data. There are two kinds of
representation in this parameters which depend on whether
the attributes are in symbolic/nominal or real values, for
example: \itemize{ \item symbolic/nominal attribute:
\code{a = c(1,2,3)} means the attribute \code{a} has values
1, 2, and 3.  \item real/continuous attribute: \code{a =
c(10, 20)} means the attribute \code{a} has values between
10 and 20.  } \item \code{nominal.attrs}: a vector
containing boolean values that show whether the related
attributes is a nominal value or not.  For example:

\code{nominal.attrs = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)} means that the
first and third attributes are continuous attributes and
otherwise for the second one.  \item \code{decision.attr}:
a numeric value representing an index of the decision
attribute. Users must define the index of the decision
attribute when they want to construct a decision table or
training dataset. But, it is a null value when constructing
a testing dataset/newdata.  It is strongly recommended that
the index of decision attribute is put on the last column
of the dataset. } It also has been provided the function
\code{\link{SF.read.DecisionTable}} which is used to import
from a file and then construct into the decision table.

################################################################
## Let use iris which is available in R be dataset
decision.table <- SF.asDecisionTable(dataset = iris, decision.attr = 5,
                  indx.nominal = 5)
